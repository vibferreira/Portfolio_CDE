							<p> 
								Forest monitoring using remotely sensed data is a central task in forestry and ecosystem studies. 
								The long-term assessment of woody vegetation assists, for instance, in change detection and handling environmental hazards. 
								Recently, France has made available its historical aerial images archive, dating from the 1930s, 
								covering the whole country extent, often with more than one revisit time per site. 
								The public availability of such datasets expands the scope of long-term monitoring studies, such as forest monitoring.
							</p> 
							<p>
								The main aim of this study was to investigate deep learning algorithms for performing semantic segmentation of woody vegetation 
								using historical grayscale aerial images in southern-west France. 
								This research's main contribution is to explore deep learning strategies to delineate trees, regardless of their spatial configuration. 

							</p>
							<!-- <p> My main duty consisted of bringing new insights and updating a fire detection algorithm developed by SERTIT. 
								The algorithm is change detection driven and it is based on several indexes, such as Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR), 
								Burn Area Index (BAI) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), developed in a Jupyter Notebook (python). 
								Despite being adapted to predict fire on Landsat and Sentinel-2 data, this internship focused mainly on Sentinel-2 imagery. 
							</p>

							<p>
								The internship’s tasks consisted in: understanding and illustrating the workflow of the implemented fire detection chain; identifying the algorithm's flaws during the post-processing stage; modifying the code to improve the zonal statistics thresholds, which used to exclude genuine fire clusters;  
								Implementing the BAIS2 spectral index; 
								Assessing accuracy by adjusting the thresholds on multiple test sites to find a generic set of values with the best output quality (measured by F1-score); 
								Delivering a commented code ready to be used in operation in SERTIT’s rapid mapping service. 
							</p>

							<p>
								The algorithm was tested at several testing sites around the globe, obtaining comparatively higher F1 scores after the changes than before. 
								However, a few testing sites, such as those in high latitude areas, remain a challenge, leaving room for improvement.
							</p>

							<p> This internship was one of the most important experiences as a graduate student in Geoinformatics. 
								It was my first opportunity to work fully in Python in  a professional environment. 
								Merci beaucoup, SERTIT, for providing me with such an interesting project and an extremely competent and thoughtful team!

							<h2> Recomendations to future interns </h2>
							<ul>
								<li>Start looking for potential internship positions and/or places you would like to work early enough;</li>
								<li>Do not hesitate to ask for advices and/or recommendations letters to the programme coordinators and/or professors; </li>
								<li>Ask as many questions as you can during your internship, it is also a learning experience!; </li>
								<li><strong>Trust your skills!</strong></li> -->
